# Student Registration Form

## Description
The **Student Registration Form** is a simple Java Swing application designed to collect student registration information. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering details such as name, course, year, gender, address, email, and contact number. The form validates input fields to ensure that all required information is provided before submission.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface for easy data entry.
- Input validation to ensure all fields are filled before submission.
- Options to select course and year from dropdown menus.
- Radio buttons for gender selection.
- Clear button to reset the form fields.
- Exit button to close the application.
- Displays a confirmation dialog upon successful registration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for Java development.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open your IDE and import the project.
3. Ensure your JDK version is compatible (Java 8 or higher recommended).
4. Compile and run the `Main` class.

### Running the Application
1. Once the application is running, fill in the required fields.
2. Click the **Submit** button to validate and submit the form.
3. If any fields are empty, a warning message will prompt you to fill all fields.
4. Use the **Clear** button to reset the form, and the **Exit** button to close the application.

## Coding Conventions
The following coding conventions were used in this project:

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - **Class Names**: Classes are named using PascalCase. For example, `Main`.
   - **Variable Names**: Variables use camelCase. For instance, `nameField`, `addressField`.

2. **Indentation and Spacing**:
   - Each level of indentation is typically done with 4 spaces.
   - Blank lines are used to separate logical sections of the code for better readability.

3. **Braces**:
   - Opening braces `{` for classes and methods are placed at the end of the line that declares the class or method.
   - Closing braces `}` are placed on a new line, aligning with the opening brace of the respective block.

4. **Commenting**:
   - JavaDoc comments (`/** ... */`) are used for class and method documentation.
   - Inline comments (`//`) are used to explain specific lines or blocks of code where necessary.

5. **Code Structure**:
   - The main class is well-structured, with declarations, constructors, and methods clearly separated.
   - Action listeners are defined inline where the components are initialized, improving encapsulation.

6. **Visibility Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers (`private`, `public`) are used appropriately to encapsulate class variables and methods.

7. **Use of Packages**:
   - Java packages (`import javax.swing.*;`) are imported at the top of the file, following the convention.

8. **Method Naming**:
   - Methods should use camelCase and be descriptive of their function. For example, `main` is clear as it serves as the entry point of the program.

9. **Consistent Formatting**:
   - Consistent use of fonts and colors in the GUI is maintained, ensuring a uniform look and feel.

10. **Event Handling**:
    - Event listeners are implemented using anonymous classes, keeping the code concise.
