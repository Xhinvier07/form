- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for Java development. 💻

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code. 📥
2. Open your IDE and import the project. 📂
3. Ensure your JDK version is compatible (Java 8 or higher recommended). 📈
4. Compile and run the `Main` class. ▶️
5. (Optional) Run the `.jar` executable file included. 📦

### Running the Application

## Coding Conventions 📜
The following coding conventions were used in this project:

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - **Class Names**: Classes are named using PascalCase. For example, `Main`.
   - **Variable Names**: Variables use camelCase. For instance, `nameField`, `addressField`.

2. **Indentation and Spacing**:
   - Each level of indentation is typically done with 4 spaces. 🔲
   - Blank lines are used to separate logical sections of the code for better readability. 📏

3. **Braces**:
   - Opening braces `{` for classes and methods are placed at the end of the line that declares the class or method.
   - Closing braces `}` are placed on a new line, aligning with the opening brace of the respective block.

4. **Commenting**:
   - JavaDoc comments (`/** ... */`) are used for class and method documentation. 📝
   - Inline comments (`//`) are used to explain specific lines or blocks of code where necessary.

5. **Code Structure**:
   - The main class is well-structured, with declarations, constructors, and methods clearly separated. ⚙️
   - Action listeners are defined inline where the components are initialized, improving encapsulation.

6. **Visibility Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers (`private`, `public`) are used appropriately to encapsulate class variables and methods. 🔒

7. **Use of Packages**:
   - Java packages (`import javax.swing.*;`) are imported at the top of the file, following the convention.

8. **Method Naming**:
   - Methods should use camelCase and be descriptive of their function. For example, `main` is clear as it serves as the entry point of the program.

9. **Consistent Formatting**:
   - Consistent use of fonts and colors in the GUI is maintained, ensuring a uniform look and feel. 🎨

10. **Event Handling**:
    - Event listeners are implemented using anonymous classes, keeping the code concise. ✨
